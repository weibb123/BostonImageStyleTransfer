# BostonImageStyleTransfer

# --Content--

The essential idea of neural style transfer is to define two distance function named d1 and d2
<br>d1 is responsible for describing how different the contenets of two images are. </br>
<br>d2 is responsible for describing the difference between two images in terms of their style.</br>
<br>Then, we take a content image and style image and transform content image by minimizing content and style distance with backpropagation</br>
